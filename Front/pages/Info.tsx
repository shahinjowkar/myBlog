                I have a bachelor of science (BSc) degree from University of
                Toronto. My passion in dentistry started when I was a kid and
                stepped into a dental office for the first time. However, during
                my undergraduate program, my interest found a more logical form.
                I was intrigued by the interactive nature of dentistry, and that
                it constantly requires surgical operations which are hands-on
                procedures and demand having close contact with patients.

                With a help of a team of interdisciplinary students, I created
                this scientific journal, which summarizes the latest and most
                interesting articles and innovations in dentistry using
                state-of-the-art A.I. system. All articles are hand-picked; and
                all summaries are fact-checked, peer reviewed, and taylored
                towards general audience with no background in dentistry. Source
                of the original articles can be found at the buttom of each
                page.

                We also run a social media club on Instagram, @pre_denthusiasts,
                throug which we introduce different dental schools and their
                requirements, answer common DAT questions, and help pre-dental
                students practice their interview skills. As a pre-dental
                student myself, I am aware of the lack of guidance for students
                interested in following dentistry, and our team hopes to close
                this gap by providing valuable information in our page.
